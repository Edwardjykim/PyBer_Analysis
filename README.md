### Reviewing this Figures:

-  Highest demands on Rides vs Total drivers count  1.6, 1.28, 0.68
-  Total Fares vs Average fare per ride
-  Average fare per Driver
Highest demands on rides and Revenues are generated on Urban cities.  For demands on rides, 13 times higher when compare it with urban and rural, about 9 times higher on revenue generated.  But when we looking into income(Average fare per Ride), rural city made about 40% more per ride than urban. 
Determine by Driver per ride ratio(Rural=1.6, Suburban=1.28, Urban=0.68), there are higher supplies on drivers on urban, this could lead to compatible pricing on rides.
