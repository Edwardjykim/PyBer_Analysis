# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Perform analysis of Pyber ride sharing in order to:
-  Determine affordability 
-  Visualize the data
-  Count rides and fares for each cities and type of cities

### Reviewing the Figures:

-  Highest demands on Rides vs Total drivers count  1.6, 1.28, 0.68
-  Total Fares vs Average fare per ride
-  Average fare per Driver
Highest demands on rides and Revenues are generated on Urban cities.  For demands on rides, 13 times higher when compare it with urban and rural, about 9 times higher on revenue generated.  But when we looking into income(Average fare per Ride), rural city made about 40% more per ride than urban. 
Determine by Driver per ride ratio(Rural=1.6, Suburban=1.28, Urban=0.68), there are higher supplies on drivers on urban, this could lead to compatible pricing on rides.

## Summary

Based on the Analysis:
1.  Promote in order to increase number of rides on Urban cities.  There are 2,400 driver but only 1,600 rides.  This is telling that there is so much room to increase volume of rides.
2.  Increase number of drivers on rural.  Average fare per driver data shows that rural cities take alot longer trips per ride.  This could result longer wait on ride to ride, and leading to lost of potential revenues that could generate farther more.
3.  In order to make better and accurate analysis, instead of few months of data, could provide whole year of data to perform analysis.  This can determine trends on each month and each season.  Therefore have better understanding about how to market it and promote Pyber.
